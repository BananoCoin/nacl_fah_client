================================================

This project contains the source code for the Open-Source frontend of
the Folding@home NaCl Client.  This client requires the Google Chrome
browser which can be downloaded [here](https://google.com/chrome/).  You
can run the client by going directly to [nacl.bananominer.com](https://nacl.bananominer.com).

# BANANO

This is a fork of the [standard nacl folding@home chrome client](https://github.com/FoldingAtHome/fah-nacl-client)

Intended to make it easy to start earning banano after registering on [bananomier.com](https://bananominer.com)

It requires a query paramter to be passed to the URL initially, e.g. https://nacl.bananominer.com?user=abcd1234

Then the username is saved in a cookie for subsequent visits.
